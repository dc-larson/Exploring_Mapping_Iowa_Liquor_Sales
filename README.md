### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise was to explore Alcohol Sales data in the
State of Iowa for 2018 to see which brands were most popular, and which
stores were selling most of the Top 2 selling brands. Going deeper, I
was curious if some of these top performing stores were located near
colleges. Some colleges tend to be large consumers of alcohol.

### Research Questions

1.  Which counties are the top 10 in sales?
2.  What are the top 10 most valuable products in terms of sales?
3.  What are the most popular liqour brands?
4.  What is the spatial distirubtion of top selling locations of the top
    two selling brands?
5.  Are these stores located near college campuses?

### Data

Iowa Liquor Sales data was obtained from
[Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/iowa-liquor-sales). A more
current version of the data can be obtained directly from the [State of
Iowa](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy).
